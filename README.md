# OperatingPlatforms

#Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
The client for this project was The Gaming Room. The game was to be called "Draw It or Lose It" and is only availble on Android at the moment. The game will be multiple teams of several people participating in four rounds at a minute a piece. When the picture is pulled from the library of images a team will guess until the minute is up. If they team fails to get the answer correctly then the other team will have 15 seconds to try and answer. The Gaming Room would like us to expand this game to multiple platforms using various software patterns. 

#What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
Something that was done well was the Development Requirements. This was something that really took some thought and research as some of these platforms I had never used or looked into.

#What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
The process of starting at the summary, working throught the constraints and then into the UML made it easier to know what the limits and what exactly needed to be done. THis is like a written version of a flow chart that makes it simple to follow what needs to be done in the code.

#If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
While I think that the Development Requirements is my strong point I think it is the thing that I would go back and revise. It seems long but with minimal detail. I think being able to provide the most detail leas to the client to know all of their options and the best possible choice.

#How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
The cost, expertise and support were all included. The end user in any program is important because they are the user. They are not a developer so it is hard to ask them to know the information that went into creating the game that they are using. They should have the best quailty with basic knowledge to know how to support and run the game. This makes it so they can enjoy the program they are buying and using.

#How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
I think this document and UMLs are something that I would use in the future. These are something that was new and made it very easy to develop software. Eclipse may not be my go to for writing but it is something that I will use going forward as well. The more that I go throught this degree program the more tools I am added to my tool box to be the best developer that I can be.
